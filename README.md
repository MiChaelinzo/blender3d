# blender3d
1.) This code uses the Blender Python API to create a new scene with a camera, a background plane, and an image plane. The code then downloads the DALL-E 2 generated prompt image, creates a new material with the image texture, and applies it to the image plane. Finally, the code positions the camera and objects, and renders the scene to a file. Also, you may need to adjust the camera distance and other parameters to fit your specific use case.
 
2.) This code should generate a 3D model of the DALL-E 2 generated image using the LeiaPix API and export it as an OBJ file.
